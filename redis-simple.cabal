Name:                redis-simple
Version:             0.1.1
Synopsis:            Simple redis bindings for Haskell
Description:         This package is meant to simplify usage of redis in
                     Haskell. It is built on the full-blown @redis@ package
                     and, in fact, does nothing more than providing an easier
                     interface to a small subset of it's functions.
